# stockanalytics
This code is created for investment analysts and amateurs who would like to know more about stocks they own. 
It allows to obtain necessary statistic measures that may be useful for stock analysis, such as: 

1. Mean 
2. Standard Deviation 
3. Skewness 
4. Kurtosis.

Main advantage of the following code is to obtain these statistics immediately for each stock.

Moreover, it also provides correlation of returns and histograms with normal distribution, which give your more sense about your investments in stock portfolio.

Correlation will bring your understanding of stock behaviour in your portfolio.

Histogram enables you to see the behaviour of the stock for a certain period of time. For example, positively skewed stock distribution is a good choice for a momentum strategy, while negatively skewed stock will be more suitable for contrarian style portfolio.
